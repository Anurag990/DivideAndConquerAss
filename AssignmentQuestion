Question 2- What is the time complexity of the Quick Select Algorithm ?
The time complexity of the QuickSelect algorithm depends on the partitioning strategy and the selection of the pivot element. 
On average, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 
However, in the worst case, the time complexity can be O(n^2).

Question 3- Which data structure is used in Quick Select algorithm?
a) Linked List
b) Array
c) Binary Tree
d) Stack
Answer - b) Array

Question 4 - Which partitioning scheme is used in Quick Select algorithm?
a) Lomuto partition scheme
b) Hoare partition scheme
c) Merge sort partition scheme
d) Heap sort partition scheme
Answer - b) Hoare partition scheme

Question 5 -What is the worst-case time complexity of Quick Select algorithm?
a) O(n)
b) O(n^2)
c) O(nlogn)
d) O(logn)
Answer - b) O(n^2)

Question 6 -In the Quick Select algorithm, which element is chosen as the pivot element?
a) The first element
b) The middle element
c) The last element
d) A random element

Answer - d) A random element
